## Gallowglass lore
**Weapons**
Gallowglasses are extremely efficient in all of their weapons. The lore game gallowglasses are all proficient in the Claymore and the Sparth axe.

**Claymore**
Gallowglasses are known for using large double-handed longswords known as Claymores. The name 'Claymore' is derived from the Gaelic word 'Claiomh Mor' which means 'big sword'. The Gallowglasses did not believe in doing anything in half measures!

**Sparth axe**
Even against a well armoured opponent, the sheer concussive force behind a blow from this axe will smash and rend the heaviest if armours.

In order to start a division one must have at least 10 points and also a good understanding of the gallowglasses (

- [ ] Add emojis
- [ ] Host first rally
- [ ] Make divisions having less uniform restrictions 
- [ ] Decide on team formation
- [ ] Decide on battle tactics

Considerations:
only 1 zwei per division (must be good at parrying)
swap out banjo and maybe allow axe
allow nails since they have them in diomhanach
have a teamfight lesson

if using half-sword its better to just use a regular sword
in teamfight its better to just use daggers instead of nails
banjo heal sucks, axe better
