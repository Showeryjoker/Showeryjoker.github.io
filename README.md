# Decaying Winter

Decaying winter is a survival and wave based shooter with heavy emphasis on individual as well as team performance and not failing. However... you...
<b>will fail.</b>

So here is a guide which will at least help make your Decaying Winter experience go a lot more smoother. A lot of these tips mostly rely on common sense but I still see so many people in public lobbies just failing to follow these simple steps.

## Perks

Decaying Winter has a variety of perks to choose from with each serving its own purpose. While not all of these are actually appropriate for competitive play... *cough* Damned *cough* most of these will still play an important part in your games. Heres a quick rundown of all the perks

### Survivor 

The player spawns in fully nourished and with a backpack which increases inventory space. Doesn't seem like much but still makes a huge difference during the night. 

### Hivemind

The player has the ability to command their army of bugs to fight for them. They can toggle between 3 different modes:

- Direct - locks on to nearby enemies and swarms them slowly dealing damage.

- Divide - creates a wall of bugs which can slow down scavengers who attempt to enter the safezone during the wave.

- Disperse - also creates a wall but covers a lot more area then Divide with the expense of having shorter range.  

The Hivemind also have a passive which slowly deals damage to scavengers when engaging them in melee combat similar to Direct. The Hivemind is an extremely versatle perk and plays a very very important role in your team. While the bugs might cause a bit of lag I think its still very much worth the trade off.
 
### Arbiter

The player spawns in with a shotgun with great knockback. The player also has the ability to fire a long ranged shot dealing greater damage which also has an AOE (Area Of Effect). The shell can be punched by firing the gun and again pressing F right when the players arm is fully extended. The player also has the ability to rocket jump but jumping and firing their gun downwards mid air. However, doing so with a long ranged shot will result in the player either dying from fall damage or the shell itself.

### Riskrunner

The player spawns in with a machine gun which can only be armed at 50%. This can be pretty good during later waves where scav war happens. Despite this the Riskrunner reduces the chance of scavenging more ammo. Another thing to take in to account is that the Riskrunner of the team should be the only one to really pick up any ammo as this regenerates the perk from its cooldown. 

### Zealot

The Zealot has a shield which can reduce damage received from incoming bullets. They can also place down a turret which shields your allies from incoming bullets while also dealing damage to the scavengers. This ability synergizes very well with the Concertina Bomb auxilliary equipment. 

### Blitzer

The Blitzer has 6 payload explosives which can deal a decent amount of damage to enemy scavengers. Keep in mind that the explosives also inflict friendly damage so make sure to communicate properly prior to detonation. All 6 of The Blitzer's payloads regenerate at the start of every night. Considering the power of explosives alongside the fact that all 6 of them replenish per night, this is a pretty solid offensive perk.

### Artillerist

The Artillerist spawns in with a revolver with which one bullet can be fired per usage. When the player successfully makes a headshot with their ability they obtain a buff called DEADEYE. DEADEYE reduces reload time, grants the player greater recoil control, greater hipfire recoil control, faster aiming speed and also halves the cooldown of the ability. Due to the fact that DEADEYE is a very useful buff which affects gun play, teammates should always let their Artillerist use guns. Alongside all of this The Artillerist increases the ammo the players can scavenge.

### Executioner

The Executioner spawns in with some goggles which give information about any enemy scavengers you see. This particularly helpful in determining how low a scavenger is. The goggles also classify all scavengers as wanted. The Executioner cannot salvage items at scrappers but they are instead awarded salvage for killing scavengers. Of course this only work with the goggles on. Same way they also obtain 1 dogtag per kill (also with their goggles on). Each dogtag accumulated increases the players melee damage. This can prove beneficial in some strategies. 

### Crosslink



### Vagabond

The Vagabond has a long blade which can be used to kill scavengers from a safe distance during close quarters combat. Each kill obtained with the blade rewards the player with 1 dogtag just like The Executioner. Holding down the perk button (F) will allow the player to use their dogtags and heal themselves (1 dogtag = 8 hp). This is a very low amount. However, another good reason to collect dogtags is, it increases your movement speed. The more dogtags you have the faster you go. This can really make life a lot easier.

### Lazarus

The Lazarus is a support class which can deal buffs and debuffs. The player can blast a shockwave which will affect nearby allies and enemies. If an ally is hit by the blast they will get the painkiller buff. This buff will remove the blood from their screen and also negate Fracture and Cripple debuffs. If an enemy is hit by the blast they will be stunned for a short period of time. If properly used can even stun lock the strongest of enemies in this game but don't get your hopes up too high as the player can only blast twice before going into cooldown. It is suggested to have your entire team group up so The Lazarus can buff everyone in one blast without having to force them to decide between buffing and debuffing.

### Drifter

### Mindflayer

The Mindflayer can throw tiny spider droids which will latch on to any nearby injured scavengers. Once latched on they will stop being hostile and even attack any other nearby scavengers. After a certain amount of time the attached droid will explode automatically killing the scavenger that is under control. The best way to make use of this perk is to have someone hit  enemy scavengers once and then The Mindflayer can take control. The Mindflayer can also place steel punjis in certain corners of the huge red container and bait the scavengers in to walking through them thus injuring them and ready to be taken control of.

### Tickspider
